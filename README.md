# Airline-Delay
Airlines dataset has 539383 instances and 8 different features. The task is to predict whether a given flight will be delayed, given the information of the scheduled departure.
The project was deployed over 3 milestones:

- In the first milestone:

1- Label/cluster the dataset using the GA and the K-Mean clustering algorithms.
2- Run the GA algorithm to find the final labeling/clustering.
3- Run the K-Mean clustering algorithm to find the final labeling/clustering.
4- Compare in terms of the MSE and the computational time KPIs.
5- presentation 5 slides only with the progress in this milestone (include graphs).

- In the second milestone:

1- Implement the SVM code for new data prediction and Classification.
2- Tune the parameters (manually) till reaching the best results.
3- Observe the effect of the parameters changing on the performance in terms of accuracy, MSE 
execution time, prediction time.
4- presentation 5 slides only with the progress in this milestone (include graphs).

- In the third milestone:

1- Implement the ANN code for new data prediction and Classification.
2- Tune the parameters (manually) till reaching the best results.
3- Observe the effect of the parameters changing on the performance in terms of accuracy, MSE 
execution time, prediction time.
4- presentation 5 slides only with the progress in this milestone (include graphs).
